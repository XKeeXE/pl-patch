# Portfolio Website
https://pl-patch.vercel.app
# Description
Portfolio website created entirely using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. The site serves as a showcase of various projects that I have passionately developed, presenting a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. I selected these projects to highlight my skills and creativity, ensuring that they are polished and ready for presentation.

In designing the user interface of the portfolio, I applied the principles of UI theory to create an engaging and intuitive experience for visitors. Every UI element has been thoughtfully placed to ensure at most the minimum information required and a layout that not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also enhances usability. 
As you navigate through the site, you will find detailed descriptions of each project, highlighting their functionality, design, and objectives.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio and GitHub. Your interest in my work means a great deal to me, as I am excited to share my skills and projects.
